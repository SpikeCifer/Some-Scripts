# Book Catalogue

## Description

Basic premise of the project is that it allows you to define a library stracture
by defining it in the catalogue.md file. The script then will create the structure
and move all files from the default directory to the directory specified in the catalogue.

## Notice

When loading/reading a data stracture the script ignores directory structures with depth
more than 5.
